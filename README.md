# Gemma Grezza - My UncutGem build

These are my edits, files and notes from my attempt to build UncutGem from Quantum Village, a Full Stack fully Open Source NV Center Diamond Magnetometer. If you want to build one, go to [Quantum Village website](https://quantumvillage.org/#test-site-intro-md) and [UncutGem github](https://github.com/QuantumVillage/UncutGem/).


## What I've done differently
- used a [custom mold](./mold) for casting the diamond 
- created a [3d printable enclosure](./model)
- build a [pcb in Kicad](./pcb)
- made some modifications to the [firmware](./firmware)
- added a button to interact with the device

## Firmware

The firmware is a custom modification of the original; in particular # TODO


## Build process & results

The build process is told in this blogpost: # TODO
